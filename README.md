# React Components

## Assignment: Refactoring a React Pokedex Application

#### Overview
In this assignment, you will refactor an existing React application that displays a simple Pokedex, a digital encyclopedia of various Pok√©mon. The current version of the app has all its logic and UI components in a single file. Your task is to improve the application's structure and maintainability by breaking it down into smaller, reusable components.

### Instructions
You are NOT modifying the display of the page. You are reorganizing the code. The page should look the exact same at the end.

### **Part 1: Header Component**

   - Extract the code for the header element into a new component called `Header`.

      - Inside Header.js, create a new react component called `Header`

         - Define a component function called Header

         - Configure the function to return the html for the header


         <details>
         <summary>Add an export statement at the bottom of Header.js that exposes the Header component function to other files</summary>

         ```
         </details>
   <br/>
